Concept:
Tollbooth smart contract with ultrasonic sensors and servo motors. Chainlink node scrapes MTA transit fee data using Adapter.js.
Chainlink pricefeeds also used to remove need for ERC20 stablecoins. Chainlink Keepers can be used assuming large vehicles take over 15 seconds to fully cross path.
